   * \brief The Problem that needs to be solved.
   *
   * The Problem class contains the Variables, Constraints, Objectives that
   * collectively define a particular problem that can be solved. A
   * problem can be described as
   * 
   * min/max f(x)
   * 
   * s.t.  l_i <= g_i(x) <= u_i, i = 1,2, ... , m
   * 
   *       l_i <= x_i <= u_i, i = 1, 2, ..., n
   * 
   * A way of setting up an problem is to first ask it to create 'n'
   * variables. Then the constraints and objective can be added one by one.  
   * 
   * A Problem is a very generic class. The Relaxation classes
   * are derived from it.
